Things to consider
------
 (Splitting not very efficent see #2)
1.  Instead of one central board data, I could have split 
    it in the state for x and o
    vs
    Splitting it later like what I did

    Pros: Would not have to create two new arrays each time,
    would save time, state cost less to write to

    Would reduce amount of code in checkWinConditon()
    -Wouldn't need to grab keys, grab data with forEach then split

(Best solution)
2.  I could have avoided dom manipulation if I just used 
{this.state.turn} in the div itself (and where turn would be x or o) vs after the fact DOM manipulation

3. I should really convert to using only class components considering the benefits and the fact
the code is about the same amount if you omit constructor + class syntax

Final Verdict: One JSX line could have solved everything
