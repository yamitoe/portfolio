Things to consider
------
Instead of one central board data, I could have split 
it in the state for x and o
vs
Splitting it later like what I did

Pros: Would not have to create two new arrays each time,
would save time, state cost less to write to

Would reduce amount of code in checkWinConditon()
-Wouldn't need to grab keys, grab data with forEach then split
